#### Zepto SQL Product Dissection Project

##  Project Overview
This project is a **SQL Product Dissection** of **Zepto (Quick Commerce)**. The goal is to analyze the product's data structure, understand its operations, and answer key business questions using SQL queries.

##  Objective
- Understand Zepto’s database structure.  
- Explore key metrics like order trends, customer behavior, and product performance.  
- Gain hands-on experience in writing **SQL queries** involving **Joins, Aggregations, CTEs, and Window Functions**.  

##  Dataset / Tables
The project uses multiple interrelated tables to simulate Zepto’s operations:

1. **Customers** – customer details (id, name, location, etc.)  
2. **Products** – product catalog (id, name, category, price, stock)  
3. **Orders** – order details (id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount)  
4. **Order_Items** – details of each product in an order (order_id, product_id, quantity)  

##  Tech Stack
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL / MySQL)  
- **Data Analysis Concepts** – Aggregation, Filtering, Sorting  
- **Joins, CTEs, Window Functions**
